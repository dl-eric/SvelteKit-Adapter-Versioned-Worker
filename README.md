# SvelteKit-Adapter-Versioned-Worker
A SvelteKit adapter for generating service workers to make your SvelteKit sites work offline.

It currently isn't ready so check back in a few week's time. When 1.0 is released, this adapter will replace my older [SvelteKit-**Plugin**-Versioned-Worker](https://github.com/hedgehog125/SvelteKit-Plugin-Versioned-Worker) as this improves on it in practically every way.
